# Selection Sort

You are to implement the selection sort algorithm that will be able to
sort numbers of an array. Your selection sort implementation must be
inplace, as in, you are to not have a copy of the array in this solution.


You will need to implement the selection sort algorithm with the following
function signature
```
function selectionSortNumbers(numbers)
```

Validate your solution against a set of unit test cases that have been
bundled with this problem.
