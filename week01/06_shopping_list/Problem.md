# Problem

You have been tasked with writing a shopping list class. You will
find that the following class is within the file `ShoppingList.js`
and that you will support the following methods on this class.

* `addItem(item)` - Adds an item onto the shopping list, this will only be a string
* `removeItem(index)` - Removes an item from the shopping list
* `markItemAsComplete(index)` - Sets the current item has complete or retrieved
* `getItem(index)` - Retrieves an item, this will be an object containing two fields: name: string and completed: boolean.
* `list()` - Returns an array containing the objects (name and completed fields) to the caller.

Use the `ShoppingList.test.js` file to test your implementation and fix problems
as you work on them. Review the scaffold code within `ShoppingList.js`.
