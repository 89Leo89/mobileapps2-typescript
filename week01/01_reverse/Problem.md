# Reverse Array

You are tasked with writing a program inside `Reverse.js` that will
reverse an array inplace. This means you will need to reverse the array
without using another reverse function (do not use a standard library
function) and not using another array.

You will need to implement this function as declared in `Reverse.js`:

```
function reverseArray(array) {
    //Your code here
}
```

Here are some examples of an array being reversed.

Example 1:

```
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
reverseArray(numbers); //Will be [4, 3, 2, 1];

```

Example 2:

```
let numbers = [9, 8, 7, 6];
reverseArray(numbers); //Will be [6, 7, 8, 9];

```

This function should work for all kinds of arrays. The array
could contain strings, numbers, objects or even other arrays.

Test your implementation against a set of test cases,
using `npm test`. Make sure you install the dependencies required
using `npm install` (without any dependency specified, assuming
    you are in the same directory as package.json).
